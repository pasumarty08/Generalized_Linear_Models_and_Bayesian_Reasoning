In this project, I worked on predicting the price variations of bitcoin, a virtual cryptographic currency. These predictions could be used as the foundation of a bitcoin trading strategy. To make these predictions, I have familiarized myself with machine learning techniques, Bayesian Regression, and implemented these techniques in Python.

To make the data to have evenly space records, I have taken all the records within a 20 second window and replaced it by a single record as the average of all the transaction prices in that window. Not every 20 second window had a record; therefore those missing entries were filled using the prices of the previous 20 observations and assuming a Gaussian distribution. The raw data that has been cleaned is given in the file dataset.csv.

Implemented the Bayesian Regression model to predict the future price variation of bitcoin as described in the reference paper: Bayesian regression and Bitcoin by Devavrat Shah and Kang Zhang (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.1231.pdf)
