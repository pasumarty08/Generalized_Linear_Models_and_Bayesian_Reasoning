# Generalized_Linear_Models_and_Bayesian_Reasoning
a) Generalized Linear Models: Logistic, Bayesian Logistic, Probit Regression, and Poisson regression: OLS vs MLE algorithms, dealing with multinomial and ordinal outcomes, correlated predictors, nominal and missing data, sampling size issues;  odds, odd ratios, link function

b) Probabilistic Reasoning under Uncertainty: Bayes Theorem,  Bayesian inference, Bayesian parameter estimation, Bayesian regression, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) vs Maximum A Posterior (MAP) estimation

c) Optimization Problems: Closed-form, Algebraic, Analytic, Numeric solutions
